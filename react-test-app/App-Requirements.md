# Comprehensive React Web Application for MCP Tooling Testing

## Role: Full-Stack React Developer / UI/UX Engineer

**Objective:** Create a modern, accessible React web application specifically designed for comprehensive MCP server tooling validation. The application should simulate realistic user workflows with comprehensive data management, state handling, and interactive UI components. Ensure the application feels natural and supports complex user journeys that will thoroughly test MCP automation capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js environment with npm/yarn package managers
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and modern web development patterns
- Understanding of REST API patterns and client-side data fetching

## Technology Stack & Developer Experience

### Core Technologies
- **React 19+** with TypeScript support for type-safe development
- **Vite** for fast build tooling and development server
- **React Aria Components** for fully accessible UI components and forms
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive styling and subtle color schemes
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state management and intelligent caching
- **React Router** for client-side navigation and routing

### Backend Simulation
- **JSON Server** for realistic REST API endpoint simulation
- **@faker-js/faker** library for generating diverse, realistic mock data with valid image URLs
- **JWT Authentication** with secure token-based session management
- **Vite Proxy Integration** for seamless API communication (configure proxy in vite.config.ts)

### Development Enhancements
- **Import Path Aliases** for better code organization:
  - `@/` → `src/`
  - `@components/` → `src/components/`
  - `@pages/` → `src/pages/`
  - `@lib/` → `src/lib/`
  - `@types/` → `src/types/`
- **TypeScript Configuration** optimized for development and production builds

## Application Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** with multiple meaningful routes for comprehensive testing
- **TypeScript** for complete type safety and better developer experience
- **Accessible Design** following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines with React Aria Components
- **Responsive Layout** with subtle gradient backgrounds and color variations for visual appeal
- **Data Simulation** through local JSON Server with relatable, business-relevant entities
- **Interactive Functionality** with working detail views and navigation to simulate real user workflows

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Visually Appealing** with subtle background gradients and color harmonies
- **Simple Yet Engaging** UI that feels professional and modern
- **Interactive Elements** that respond naturally to user actions
- **Loading States** and smooth transitions for better perceived performance

### Data Layer Architecture

#### JSON Server with Vite Proxy
**Location:** `./mock-api` (isolated directory for clean development workflow)
**Purpose:** Simulate realistic business API with interconnected data relationships

**API Integration Strategy:**
- Configure Vite proxy: `/api/*` routes proxy to `http://localhost:3001`
- React Query uses relative paths (e.g., `/api/users`, `/api/posts`)
- No absolute URLs in API calls for better portability

**Generated Data Models with Realistic Properties:**

- **User Profile**: `id, username, email, firstName, lastName, avatar, role, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt`
- **Blog/Content Post**: `id, title, content, authorId, tags, publishDate, status, views, likes, coverImage`
- **Product**: `id, name, description, price, category, imageUrls, stock, rating, reviews`
- **System Notification**: `id, type, title, message, userId, isRead, createdAt, actionUrl`

**Advanced Data Generation Rules:**
- Generate 15-75 records per entity type with realistic variety
- Include proper entity relationships (posts link to users, notifications to users)
- Create valid, loading image URLs from reputable sources like Lorem Picsum
- Generate timestamps across recent date ranges with natural distribution
- Add semantic variety: different writing styles, product categories, user roles
- Cross-reference data: user avatars, post authors, product images

#### React Query Configuration & Patterns
**Global Query Configuration:**
- Configure appropriate stale/cache times for different data types
- Implement exponential backoff retry strategies for network resilience
- Enable React Query DevTools for development debugging
- Set up error boundaries and fallback states

**Recommended Query Implementation:**
- Use `useQuery` for read operations with appropriate data keys
- Implement `useMutation` for create/update/delete operations with cache updates
- Add optimistic updates for improved perceived performance
- Configure background refetching policies

### Application Routing & Navigation Structure

#### Route Configuration & Security
- **`/`** → Auto-redirect based on authentication status
- **`/login`** → User authentication entry point with Zod validation
- **`/register`** → User registration with Zod validation
- **`/dashboard`** → Protected main application interface with activity overview
- **`/posts`** → Protected blog post listing with search and filtering
- **`/posts/:id`** → Protected detailed post view with author information
- **`/products`** → Protected product catalog with category filtering
- **`/products/:id`** → Protected product detail page with reviews and actions
- **`/users`** → Protected user directory for social interaction simulation
- **`/users/:id`** → Protected user profile with post history and settings
- **`/settings`** → Protected application preferences and theme customization

#### Navigation System
